Hello Odin!
HmmmMM so i'm quite confused why we have to learn about this butt ehhhhh who cares
anywaysss to do this repos thingy uhhhh yhh this is a tutorial ig
first you make a new direcctory "mkdir repos" 
then you move into that directory "cd repos" 
you go to git hub where on the top right hand corner you can make a new repository
a repository is a place where that info is stored
name it, and possibly add a README file -> maybe for other users??
then you press to create it
after you then press code then remember to pick the SSH choice and copy that URL
you then go back to terminal and type in "git clone <the URL enter into here>
then after that try out git remote -v
idrk what that does for now
but ig just give it a go??? and keep practicing making changes and saving themm :DD
happy Git using!!
