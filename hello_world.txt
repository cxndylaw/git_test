test test 
i would like to see if this works
hmMMmmm so ig i'll make this part of my notes on how to do this
ok so first u edit changes on this document
then u need to save it by pressing cmd + save
then after that go back to terminal and you can press git status to check if it is working
then u need to add that by typing "git add <file>..."
then if you want to check it again you can type "git status" again
then to "commit" save your changes then you would type "git commit -m "whatever message or desc on what changes you made??" 
then to publish it to git hub you would have to type git push origin main or just git push (beginning)
